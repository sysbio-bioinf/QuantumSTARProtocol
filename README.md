# QuantumSTARProtocol
STAR Protocol for the use of cloud-based QPUs for Quantum Boolean network analysis

All analyses for reproducing the analyses presented in the original publication by Weidner et al. (2023) in Cell Patterns are described in the .ipynb Jupyter notebook.
This contains various local simulations of quantum circuits for analysing dynamic properties of Quantum Boolean networks.
Additionally, the procedures for accessing real quantum processors from IBM and IonQ are described.
